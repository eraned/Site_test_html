        <h1>About me</h1>
        <div id="content">
            Hey! my name is <b>Satoshi Nakamoto </b> and this is my personal site! im 43 yers old and i have invented the bitcoin the first digital currency and implemented the first blockchain database.
            but in the Spring of 2011, Nakamoto returned to leave a final message ,That was the last the world heard of the secretive Bitcoin creator.
            The mystery behind Nakamoto’s identity has only grown, as the Bitcoin community eagerly speculates who it could potentially be.
            Satoshi Nakamoto claims to be Japanese, born on April 5, 19753. It is unknown whether Nakamoto is male or female, or whether Nakamoto is even a single person or a group of individuals.
            <br/>
            There is still doubt about the real identity of Satoshi Nakamoto ,To date, there are several potential individuals suspected of being the mysterious Bitcoin creator:
            <br/>
            1.One of the first suggestions was <b>Nick Szabob</b>, a decentralized currency enthusiast who published a paper on “bit gold” considered to be a precursor to the first cryptocurrency.
            Running a reverse textual analysis, internet researcher Skye Grey found dozens of unique phrases that linked Szabo’s writing style to that of the original White Paper6. This evidence is only circumstantial.
            however, and Szabo has repeatedly denied that he is the creator of Bitcoin.
            <br/>
            2.Another possibility is a Japanese American man living in California, named <b>Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto</b>, birth name Satoshi Nakamoto.
            First brought up in a March 2014 Newsweek article, Leah McGrath Goodman pointed to Nakamoto’s training as a physicist at Cal Poly University in Pomona and libertarian background as potential indicators of his identity.
            <br/>
            3.<b>Hal Finney</b> is another potential candidate to be the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto. Finney was a pre-bitcoin cryptographic pioneer and was only the second person – after Nakamoto himself – to make use of the software, file bug reports, and suggest improvements.
            Furthermore, he was the first to ever receive Bitcoin, stating in an interview that “ [he] was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction, when Satoshi sent ten coins to [him] as a test.9”
            <br/>
            4.Yet another possible contender to be Satoshi Nakamoto is the Australian academic, computer engineering expert, and entrepreneur, <b>Craig Wright</b>. In early November of 2015, Gizmodo received an anonymous email from an individual stating that not only did he know that Craig Wright was the creator of Bitcoin,
            but that he had also worked for him11. On December 9, hours after Wired certified that Wright was indeed Nakamoto, the Australian Federal Police raided his home, and afterwards stating the
            “[the] matter is unrelated to recent media reporting regarding the digital currency Bitcoin.” Afterwards, Wright deleted his internet presence until May of 2016, when he stepped forward and revealed himself on Twitter as the creator of the digital currency Bitcoin12, and claimed he had the proof to back up his statement.
            Then, amid a torrent of skepticism, Wright retracted his statement and did not offer the “extraordinary proof” he claimed to have, stating that he did “not have the courage” to prove his identity13.
            <br/>
            In an era where information is widespread, Satoshi Nakamoto has managed to maintain his identity a complete secret. So why is uncovering Nakamoto’s identity so important? If Nakamoto is indeed a single individual, then he or she owns approximately 5% of the world’s Bitcoin supply,
            placing him or her as the 52nd richest person in the world as of December 12th14.
            Ultimately, identifying Bitcoin’s creator may be a quixotic endeavor. His or her complete silence since the Spring of 2011 means it is likely we will never hear from them again.
            Nevertheless, Bitcoin, the open source digital currency created nearly a decade ago, will continue to in spite of this mystery. The Bitcoin community will be forced to coexist with the enigma that is Satoshi Nakamoto, for the better or for the worst.
